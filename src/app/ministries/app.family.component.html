      Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the vision of Calvary Church Family Ministry (CCFM) is to reflect
      wholeness in our churchâ€™s family units, to equip parents to disciple and take spiritual leadership in their homes,
      as well as to foster better relationships within and between the families at Calvary Church,
      essentially extending Calvary beyond our church walls.
